# Rust Projects

A collection of Rust projects Iâ€™m building to learn systems programming, performance optimization, and safe concurrency. This repo includes both small practice exercises and larger exploratory projects.  

## ðŸ¦€ Learning Goals

Rust is known for its **memory safety**, **speed**, and **concurrency without data races**. Through these projects, Iâ€™m focusing on:

- Mastering **ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes**  
- Writing safe and efficient **concurrent programs**  
- Building **command-line tools** and utilities  
- Experimenting with **data structures and algorithms** in Rust  
- Exploring **Web3 / blockchain integrations** with Rust-based frameworks  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Types

This repo will contain projects across different areas:

- **Beginner Exercises** â€“ syntax practice, control flow, modules  
- **CLI Tools** â€“ small utilities built with `cargo`  
- **Systems Programming** â€“ memory management and low-level concepts  
- **Web3 Experiments** â€“ exploring frameworks like [Substrate](https://substrate.io/) or [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/)  
- **Exploratory Projects** â€“ anything experimental or fun I build while learning  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Clone the repo and run projects with [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), Rustâ€™s package manager and build system:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JP2308/Rust-Projects.git
cd Rust-Projects
cargo run --bin project_name
